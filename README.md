Registration is free and will always be free! It requires only a unique username and password and you are good to go.

Once you are logged in, you have access to the entire Earth in a brilliant **WebGL 3D** high definition graphics by accessing the **globe menu**.<a href="http://tinypic.com?ref=2lsunft" target="_blank"><img src="http://i59.tinypic.com/2lsunft.jpg" border="0" alt="Image and video hosting by TinyPic"></a> Here you can search for your destination in our handy **search bar** if you know where you wish to go or take advantage of our random country menu. Alternatively, you can click on the globe and a pin will drop on the chosen location. You can zoom in as much as your heart desires and the images are the best that the humankind has to offer for you today. The places that you have chosen will appear on your right and give you the option to **add to a trip**. You should have a minimum of two points to add a trip but only the sky is the limit. When you are done selecting your places, you can click **Add to trip** and they will be automatically added to your trips. 

My trips menu conveniently displays the transport needed to complete the trip, the beginning and end destination and **Show trip** button. If there are more than two places within this trip, you will see ‘…’ in between the start and end points. The Show trip button reveals a map with the route.

**My places** shows a small sized map and some Google Places images from the current latitude and longitude onclick. Currently the query string is set to hotel.
